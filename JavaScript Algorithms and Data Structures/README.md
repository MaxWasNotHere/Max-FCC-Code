These are the projects I've made following the inststructions given in FCC, if you are here for easy solutions, well here it all is. 
But please give all the problems a try, it is really satisifying to see everything completed with your own two hands. 

Also if you are a recruiter reading this, feel free to reach me on linkedin :)
